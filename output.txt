Summary : 

To handle ambiguous user queries, I implemented a routing mechanism using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) with three tools â€” add_task, set_reminder, and get_query. The system prompt guides the agent to detect user intent and select the right tool. If the intent is unclear, the assistant asks a clarifying question, like "I can help you fetch tasks or reminders, or create new ones. What would you like to do?"

A key challenge was handling date parsing, especially for relative dates like "today" or "tomorrow." I used the dateparser library to extract dates, adding a fallback to return "Unable to parse the date" if parsing fails. This ensures the assistant provides meaningful feedback and maintains a smooth conversation flow.
